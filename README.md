A ip adress is bacically your home or the location of whatever device you have tracked or put in the ip. It uses decimals and dots to give you the location of where the connection is coming from and if you trying moving away it will still track it. As long as you having to to track then it will always give you the ip adress in decimals. The webpages are stored in the servers because its a way they can communicate to the point where you send and recieve information to each other. With internet aound you'll be able to access it and as long as it has a server then i'll be up and running for everyone to use.
